Report:

Currently networkdriver.c compiles and runs. 
grep Error, Warning and BUG yield no return when performed on mydemo's output.

I am extremely pleased with my work on this project. 

See diagram.pdf for my design diagram, but implementation decisions were:
	[]incoming_thread
	       +originally I thought I would use blocking_get_pd prior to the
		init_packet_descriptor call to ensure that thread can't proceed
		until a packet has been received, else the following 
		initializer will fail due to an unsynchronized state.
		However, after testing and dropping packets I decided to
		switch to nonblocking_get_pd to increase packet availability
		and it ended my packet dropping errors.
	       +use nonblocking_get_pd to allow the thread to continue, 
		since synchronization of pd at that point is non important.
	[]outgoing_thread
	       +use blockingReadBB to read packet descriptor in from bbin
		buffer. Must block, else the packet descriptor will be
		attempted to pass in an unsynchronized state.
	       +use nonblocking_put_pd for quick turn around since return 
		the pd being sent to the fpds will be unneccessary for the 
		upcoming loop of the outgoing_thread.
	[]init_network_driver
	       +made buffers at a size that seemed to be more than enough 
		without being excessive. Not sure what the implementation of
		BoundedBuffer.c looks like, but I feel like 2-4 is appropriate
		per pd.

Assistance:
	Elizabeth helped evaluate my design and direction as well as with 
	the basics of my two pthread functions.

	I received minor debugging help from Raleigh, a masters student. The
	degree of this was I told him my errors, and he told me a likely cause.
	
	I used the video at youtube.com/fcHngVr4y7M for help with pthreads. 
	
	StackOverflow and other online resources helped in debugging.
